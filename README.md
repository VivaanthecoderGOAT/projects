# projects
just my projects which I have created throughout high school and college

This project analyzes vehicle crash data from the Prosper, Frisco, Allen, Plano, and Mckinney area and develop a model to predict what severity of crash a certain crash is based on several variables
Aditionally uses clustering algorithms to cluster the top 10 streets with the most crashes.
